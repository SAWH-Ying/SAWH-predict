This is the code to draw Figure 6 (SEC map)

cal_SBCool.m is a function of the calculated energy consumption. The inputs are temperature, humidity, pressure and isotherms, respectively. Output is SEC. 

RH_cal.m is a function to calculate relative humidity.The inputs are temperature, humidity, and pressure, respectively. Output is RH. 

RSD.m is a function that calculates the RSD of one-dimensional data.

Main1_data_deal.m is the main programme for processing meteorological data.

Main2_day_cal.m is the main programme to caltulate the SEC for every MOFs throughout the year.

Main2_day_cal.m is the main programme to plot figure 6.
