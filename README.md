# SAWH-predict
SAWH-predict calculations for the paper "Global practical potential for metal–organic frameworks assisted atmosphere water harvesting", currently in-review at Nature Water.

This code predicts water withdrawal and minimum energy requirements for SAWH installations with different MOFs.

This code is recommended to run on MATLAB R2021a or higher.

We mapped the potentials of different MOFs sorbents in terms of specific water yield and specific energy consumption, respectively derived in two models based on passive and active SAWH system. In both models, the input was the local surface environmental working conditions. The raw data were 2021 hourly time-averaged two-dimensional data with a spatial resolution of 0.625° × 0.5°, obtained from the NASA Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 project30. This ensemble consists of surface atmospheric temperature, humidity, surface pressure and incoming shortwave flux (i.e., solar radiation).
