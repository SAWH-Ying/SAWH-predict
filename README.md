# SAWH-predict
SAWH-predict calculations for the paper "Global practical potential for metal–organic frameworks assisted atmosphere water harvesting", currently Pre-accept at Cell Reports Physical Science.

Before you start runing the code, there are a few things should be noted.

i) This code is recommended to run on MATLAB R2021a or higher. While we try to avoid updates from recent years when writing code, we still recommend running with our configuration.

ii)Some of the code paths will need to be modified, and we will mark the significance of this variable in front of the data read path wherever possible.

iii) The original data is too large to upload to github, please go to the official website to download if you need. The raw data were 2021 daily hourly time-averaged two-dimensional data with a spatial resolution of 0.625° × 0.5°, obtained from the NASA Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 project30.

iv) We mapped the potentials of different MOFs sorbents in terms of specific water yield and specific energy consumption, respectively derived in two models based on passive and active SAWH system. In both models, the input was the local surface environmental working conditions, consists of surface atmospheric temperature, humidity, surface pressure and incoming shortwave flux (i.e., solar radiation).

v) Any additional information required to reanalyze the data reported in this paper is available from the lead contact upon request.
